## Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript

### Overview
------------

This code demonstrates various concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript, including object literals, constructor functions, prototypes, inheritance, and more.

### Object Literals and the 'this' Keyword
-----------------------------------------

*   An object literal is created with properties and methods.
*   The 'this' keyword is used to reference the object itself.

### Constructor Functions
-------------------------

*   A constructor function is defined to create objects with specific properties and methods.
*   The 'new' keyword is used to create instances of the constructor function.

### Literals vs Built-in Constructors
--------------------------------------

*   The difference between using literals and built-in constructors (e.g., String, Number, Boolean, Array, Object) is demonstrated.

### Working with Object Properties
---------------------------------

*   Properties are added, deleted, and checked for existence.
*   Object methods (hasOwnProperty, keys, values, entries) are used to manipulate and inspect objects.

### Prototypes and the Prototype Chain
--------------------------------------

*   Prototypes are used to add methods to objects.
*   The prototype chain is demonstrated, showing how objects inherit properties and methods.

### Adding Methods to the Prototype
-----------------------------------

*   Methods are added to the prototype of a constructor function.
*   Instances of the constructor function inherit these methods.

### Object.create
-----------------

*   The Object.create method is used to create objects with a specified prototype.

### Prototypical Inheritance and call()
----------------------------------------

*   Prototypical inheritance is demonstrated using the Object.create method.
*   The call() method is used to call a constructor function with a specific context.

### OOP Game Challenge
----------------------

*   A simple game is implemented using OOP concepts, including player levels and points.
